## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## iPak Function

```{r Library, include=FALSE}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#install and load multiple R packages needed for analysis

ipak <- function(pkg){
    new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
    if (length(new.pkg)) 
        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE, repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}

# Package list.  Contains all needed packages as a this writing. To update, simply add new package name to the list!

packages <- c("ggplot2", 
              "plyr",

## Load data into R Markdown

```{Load data, include=FALSE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Bacteria.df<-read.delim("Vincent16S.final.subsample.tax.summary")
Bacteria.df<-Bacteria.df[,1:59]

pd=position_dodge(width = 0.4)
